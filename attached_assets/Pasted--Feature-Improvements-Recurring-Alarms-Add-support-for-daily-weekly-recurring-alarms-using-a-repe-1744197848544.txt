🌟 Feature Improvements
Recurring Alarms: Add support for daily/weekly recurring alarms using a repeat field:

python
Copy
Edit
'repeat': 'daily'  # or 'weekly'
Natural Language Improvements: Use a library like duckling (through a hosted service) or chrono in JS if you offload to a microservice, for better natural language parsing (e.g. “next Monday at 6pm”).

User Reminder DMs: Add an option to send the alarm message via DM instead of in the channel:

python
Copy
Edit
'dm': True
Snooze Support: After sending an alarm, offer the user to "snooze" (e.g., !snooze <id> <minutes>).

🛠️ Code Optimizations & Reliability
Alarm Trigger Robustness: Use asyncio.create_task() or queue to avoid blocking if alarm sending stalls on one user.

File I/O Handling: Wrap save_data() and load_data() with file locks (threading.Lock) to avoid race conditions between alarm check/save and command calls.

Alarm Check Loop Efficiency: Reduce CPU usage by skipping iteration if there are no alarms:

python
Copy
Edit
if not alarms:
    return
ID Generation Optimization: Use itertools.count instead of global next_alarm_id to clean up ID management.

🔐 Security & Validation
Validate Message Length: Prevent abuse via long alarm messages that might flood a channel.

Permissions Check: For commands like !setlogchannel, double-check the bot has send_messages permissions in that channel.

📊 Extras & Quality of Life
Alarm Countdown Command: Show how long until the next alarm:

bash
Copy
Edit
!nextalarm
Timezone Autodetection (Optional): Use GeoIP (e.g., via a web service) or default based on system time offset on !settimezone auto.

Slash Commands: Migrate to Discord Application Commands (Slash) for better UX.

Web UI Dashboard (Bonus): Since you have Flask, consider adding a web dashboard where users can view and manage alarms.

✅ Small Cleanups
Consider renaming free_alarm_id() → release_alarm_id() for clarity.

In your on_message_delete, truncate long messages more clearly (add "...").
